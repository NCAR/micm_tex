abstract = {In the numerical simulation of atmospheric transport-chemistry processes, a major task is the integration of the stiff systems of ordinary differential equations describing the chemical transformations. It is therefore of interest to systematically search for stiff solvers which can be identified as close to optimal for atmospheric applications. In this paper we continue our investigation from Sandu et al. (1996, CWI Report NM-R9603 and Report in Comput. Math., No. 85) and compare eight solvers on a set of seven box-models used in present day models. The focus is on Rosenbrock solvers. These turn out to be very well suited for our application when they are provided with highly efficient sparse matrix techniques to economize on the linear algebra. Two of the Rosenbrock solvers tested are from the literature, viz. rodas and Ros4, and two are new and specially developed for air quality applications, viz. rodas3 and ros3.}
