abstract = {In many applications of atmospheric transport-chemistry problems, a major task is the numerical integration of the stiff systems of ordinary differential equations describing the chemical transformations. This paper presents a comprehensive numerical comparison between five dedicated explicit and four implicit solvers for a set of seven benchmark problems from actual applications. The implicit solvers use sparse matrix techniques to economize on the numerical linear algebra overhead. As a result they are often more efficient than the dedicated explicit ones, particularly when approximately two or more figures of accuracy are required. In most test cases, sparse RODAs, a Rosenbrock solver, came out as most competitive in the 1% error region. Of the dedicated explicit solvers, TWOSTEP came out as best. When less than 1% accuracy is aimed at, this solver performs very efficiently for tropospheric gas-phase problems. However, like all other dedicated explicit solvers, it cannot efficiently deal with gas-liquid phase chemistry. The results presented may constitute a guide for atmospheric modelers to select a suitable integrator based on the type and dimension of their chemical mechanism and on the desired level of accuracy. Furthermore, we would like to consider this paper an open invitation for other groups to add new representative test problems to those described here and to benchmark their numerical algorithms in our standard computational environment.}

abstract = {In the numerical simulation of atmospheric transport-chemistry processes, a major task is the integration of the stiff systems of ordinary differential equations describing the chemical transformations. It is therefore of interest to systematically search for stiff solvers which can be identified as close to optimal for atmospheric applications. In this paper we continue our investigation from Sandu et al. (1996, CWI Report NM-R9603 and Report in Comput. Math., No. 85) and compare eight solvers on a set of seven box-models used in present day models. The focus is on Rosenbrock solvers. These turn out to be very well suited for our application when they are provided with highly efficient sparse matrix techniques to economize on the linear algebra. Two of the Rosenbrock solvers tested are from the literature, viz. rodas and Ros4, and two are new and specially developed for air quality applications, viz. rodas3 and ros3.}
